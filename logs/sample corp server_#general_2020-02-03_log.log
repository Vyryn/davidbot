Message logged at 02/03/20 11:15:57 by Bot David8#4665 in Guild: sample corp server in Channel general: with Content: Good news. I was able to find your profile. Plus, I was able to confirm you're in The Corporation. I wasn't able to find `I am Slimey's little helper#6796 on Discord.` in your bio. **__Please add that to your bio and then re-run this command.__**

Message logged at 02/03/20 11:43:16 by User Vyryn#4618 in Guild: sample corp server in Channel general: with Content: It's a question I suppose; should I let the Corp tag get assigned if everything checks out but the bot just isn't able to record it in the database, or no?
Message logged at 02/03/20 11:43:51 by User Slimey2#9610 in Guild: sample corp server in Channel general: with Content: if the database record/validation is part of the registration system then no.
Message logged at 02/03/20 11:44:30 by User Slimey2#9610 in Guild: sample corp server in Channel general: with Content: I suppose that you check the db if the combination user/rsi is already present?
Message logged at 02/03/20 11:46:39 by User Vyryn#4618 in Guild: sample corp server in Channel general: with Content: Yes
Message logged at 02/03/20 11:47:49 by User Vyryn#4618 in Guild: sample corp server in Channel general: with Content: But it may still make sense to complete the registration, because the odds are low and the clash is low stakes
